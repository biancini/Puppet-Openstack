Puppet modules to install OpenStack on linunx
=============================================

This project contains pupped modules for different pieces of software, in particular
it is intended to provide the required installation steps for OpenStack.

This project started from the modules from puppetlabs and patched and modified some
of them to correct problems in OpenStack installation.

The module has been developed and tested on Debian linux systems.
